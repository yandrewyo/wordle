# wordle
Personal project using HTML/CSS/JS

A clone of the popular game wordle.

Keep guessing five letter words until you guess the word correctly. Green tiles mean the letter is in the right spot. Yellow tiles mean the letter is in the word, but not in the right spot. Gray tiles mean the letter is not in the word. The number of green and yellow tiles for a set letter will always be less than or equal to the number times the set letter is in the answer.

Uses html table, tr, and td elements to represent letters in each guess. Can use both keyboard and html-created keyboard. Playable on both laptops and phones. May be sized weirdly depending on screen dimensions. Local storage to store previous guesses and the word being guessed in case you want to take a day to think!
